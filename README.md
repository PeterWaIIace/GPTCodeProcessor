Using chatGPT (based on reversed Engineered API) to generate runable python code, fix errors in runtime and finally have someone to do my job.

Make ChatGPT generate code!

RevChatGPT can be less resilent due to its reversed engineered nature and being based on highly used ChatGPT - which is currently in demand.
